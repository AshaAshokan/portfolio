										<h3 class="blog_heading">Overview</h3>
										<p class="pt-3 pb-3">The world has become increasingly digital, with online shopping for everything from clothing to groceries. However, people are still hesitant to use digital medical services, as health is a crucial aspect of our lives. To address this issue, I am creating an application that offers various features, such as virtual doctor consultations, lab test booking, and an e-commerce platform for purchasing healthcare products.</p>
										
										<p>The design of this feature is challenging, as the target audience is broad, ranging from ages 18 to 60. To ensure the best possible user experience, it is essential to consider the problems faced by users with existing apps and design an app with a user-friendly interface.</p>
										<!-- <blockquote>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">What’s the Process?</h3>
										<p class="pt-3 pb-3">For this requirement, I have chosen to use the Design Thinking process. I selected this approach because it is an effective methodology and mindset for addressing complex issues, especially those that are centered around human needs. By using Design Thinking, I aim to find the best solution to this challenge in a user-centric way.</p>
										<p>There are 5 Stages in the Design Thinking Process:<br>
											<b>Empathize →Define → Ideate Design → Test</b>
											
											</p>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Empathize</h3>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3">In this phase, I conducted user research to understand the pain points that users are facing in other medical apps and what they are expecting from a medical app. I conducted some market research<br></p>

												<p class="pt-1">I analyzed the features of existing medical apps to see what features are most popular and what features are missing.</p>

												<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3">Market research</h4>
												<p class="pt-3">My desk research has given me many insights from a different perspective. I have seen a lot of statistics about the medical industry and online medical services. This has allowed me to understand the problems from the majority's point of view and get involved completely.</p>
												<blockquote><i class="fas fa-quote-left blockquote_icon"></i><b>Key Insights from the Market Research</b><br>
												<ul class="pt-3">
													<li>The number of doctor consultations crosses 4 billion in India in FY21, spending a total of $26 billion on outpatient prescriptions. “It is likely to grow at 13 percent over the next three years,” said the report.</li>
													<li>Before the pandemic, 3.5 million households were ordering medicines online, that number increased to 8.8 million after three months of the lockdown. (Report, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce).</li>
													
													<li>Analysis indicates that 1 in 35 consultations will happen online by FY24.
													Practo, 1Mg, Pharmeasy, Mfine, Apollo, Netmeds, and a few apps are mostly used in India.</li></ul></blockquote>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Define</h3>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3">I have surveyed many people about why they have not tried online doctor consultations. The majority of respondents said that they <b>"cannot trust online consultations."</b><br></p>

											</div>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Ideate</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">Let’s take all the problems and ideate about the solutions for all the problems that are mentioned above.</p>

											<h5 class="pt-3">User Flow</h5>
											<p class="pt-3">I first sketched out my ideas on paper. Then, I created a user flow and made dozens of corrections until I came up with the final one.</p>
											<div class="signature">

											</div>

											<h5 class="pt-3">My Moodboard</h5>
											<p class="pt-3">I believe that one of the best ways to start designing a great UI is to consume a lot of great designs. I had all of the wireframes ready, but the UI needs to be carefully crafted so that it is accessible to all users. I have not only looked at these screenshots, but I have also checked out every app in the same category and tried to understand how they make their apps easy to use.</p>

											</div>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Design</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">These screens create the first impression of the overall app. They are the best place to showcase the app's data and how it can help users. Therefore, I am trying to highlight the main screens of the feature that can make users want to get started with Medic.</p>

											<h5 class="pt-3">Consultation Home Screen</h5>
											<p class="pt-3">After many iterations, I have finally created a design for the consultation screen. I understand that this screen is important because it is the main interface for users to access consultation features and functions. Therefore, I have designed it with a minimalist approach and incorporated the findings from my research to make it more user-friendly and accessible.

											</p>
											<p class="pt-3">Here is a detailed explanation of each element included in the Homescreen design:</p>

												<img src="assets/images/figjam_6.png" alt="image" style="max-width: 45%;">
												
											</div>
											<h5 class="pt-3">Video Consultation</h5>
											<p class="pt-3">The images show a chat conversation between a patient and a doctor. This chat platform is designed to provide patients with instant access to medical advice and support. It also allows patients to have a face-to-face consultation with their doctor without having to physically visit the clinic. Existing users can upload past medical reports to the platform and share them directly with their doctor during the consultation.</p>

											</div>
											<h5 class="pt-3">Making the App Accessible for Colorblind People</h5>
											<p class="pt-3"><b>Fact:</b> Overall, approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some form of color blindness.</p>
											<p class="pt-3">In the healthcare industry, it is important to make apps accessible to people with color blindness. To make our app user-friendly for these users, we have implemented a text hierarchy throughout the app. This helps to distinguish different sections and information. Additionally, we have underlined call-to-action text to clearly indicate that it is a button that can be interacted with. This way, everyone, including people with color blindness, can easily navigate and understand the app.</p>

											</div>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Iterate</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">The testing phase is an essential part of the UX design process. It allows us to evaluate the user experience of the app and identify areas for improvement. The goal of this phase was to assess the usability, functionality, and overall user satisfaction with the online doctor consultation app.</p>
											<p class="pt-3"><b>Test Method:</b> During the beta phase, we tracked user experience with this feature, including usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction. We analyzed the data collected during this phase using a combination of quantitative metrics, such as task completion rates and time on task, as well as qualitative feedback.</p>
											<p class="pt-3"><b>Results:</b> The results of the testing phase indicated that most participants found the app to be easy to use and effective in scheduling a consultation with a doctor. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the app, with a satisfaction rate of 90%. However, we found some insights from the beta version that will help us improve the feature.</p>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">What I have learned:</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">As a Product designer working on a <b>Online Consultation</b> Feature, I have gained valuable insights and knowledge throughout the design process. Some of the key things I have learned include</p>
											<p class="pt-3">- <b>Understanding user needs</b> was the starting point of the design process. I conducted research to understand the needs and pain points of users, including both patients and doctors. This helped me to identify the core features and functionalities that needed to be incorporated into the app.
											</p>
											<p class="pt-3">- <b>The importance of simplicity</b> was a key takeaway from the app design process. I learned that it is important to keep the user interface simple and intuitive. A complex and cluttered design can be confusing and frustrating for users, especially older individuals who may not be tech-savvy.
											</p>
											<p class="pt-3">- <b>Incorporating user feedback</b> was an essential part of the design process. I received regular feedback from users and made adjustments to the feature accordingly. This helped me to ensure that the feature was meeting their needs and expectations, and to make any necessary changes to improve the overall user experience.
											</p>
											<h6 class="pt-3">
												In conclusion, designing an online consultation feature has been a challenging and rewarding experience. It has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the needs of users and develop my skills as a product designer.
