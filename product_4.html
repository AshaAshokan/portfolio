											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">What we do</h3>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3">Because of the pandemic, the world was under in lockdown that puts everyone into virtual communication from family meetings to co-operate events, even all government meetings made virtually. Zoho products took a strong stand in market. So we got a oppertunity to make zoho meeting to stand in zoho products and also in market. For that, we decided to revamp and change the user experiance better and effortless

											</p>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3">
												<b>The research</b> was a very crucial step to begin to design the solution because the research was the only way which will tell me whether the problem I noticed is genuine or not & designing a solution really benefits a large group of people or not. I categorized the research into three parts i.e. target audience, interviewing with the target audience, & market research
											</p>

												<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span> Target audiance</h4>
												<p class="pt-3">Due to the pandemic, we gone with the only option of virtual interview </p>

													<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span> Interview & Market research</h4>
												<p class="pt-3">After discussion with team, our target audience was channelized into three segments. All the three have two type of users ‘Precenter and Participants’ </p>
												
										
													

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Identifying pain points</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">After interviewing with current users and people who had never seen the product before, it became clear that there were several issues with the current user experience which manufactured hidden features and clutter in the meeting window.</p>
											<p class="pt-3">Primary and secondary research was conducted in order to get familiar with different video conferencing platforms, user opinions, their experience, wishes and needs. Based on the current users and new users feedback and suggestions we figured few pain points that needed to cover.</p>
											<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span>Research Insights</h4>

											
											<blockquote>
												<ul class="pt-3">
													<li>Banners are reserved for actionable information. Tapping on a banner or its call-to-actions should always trigger an event.</li>
													<li>These are considered more disruptive than toasts and should be used sparingly for only urgent information.</li>
													<li>These can self dismiss if no longer relevant (e.g. incoming call never answered) but expect user interaction.</li>
													<li>Banners support at most two actions — a primary and secondary. The secondary action should be a dismiss action, as a discoverable and consistent way to dismiss the banner. The swipe right gesture is supplementary, but shouldn’t be the only mechanism to dismiss.</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>

											
											<p class="pt-3">we came to the conclusion to revamp the entire PP module without affecting the existing long time users who used to be with the current UX/UI since we are not doing something from scratch.</p>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Challenge</h3>
											<div class="signature pt-1">
												
												<img src="assets/images/zh_3.png" alt="image" style="max-width: 60%;">
											</div>
											<p class="pt-3">The new, refined meeting UI is everything you need for a distraction-free, productive session. Focused on the discussion at hand with no clutter in the meeting window. Use the minimal meeting toolbar for anything you need during a meeting: taking notes, chat, adjusting settings, audio, or setting preferences. Set your meeting toolbar to disappear after use for a zero-clutter interface or make it stationary throughout.</p>
											<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span>Empathy mapping</h4>
											<blockquote>
												<p class="pt-3">Here we have two type of users.</p>

											<p class="pt-3">We have to keep records of scheduled, conducted such as past meeting and upcoming meeting for the user, Now we have a basic list view with the number of upcoming, past, recording so we decided to revamp the meeting list page for better user experience with productivity and intuitive design.</p>

											</div>

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Usability testing:</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">After the visual design was complete I tested the prototype with a few users to see how user-friendly the application is. The test was in Zoho meeting video calls where the participants were given the following tasks while I observed how they navigated through the application.


											</p>
											<blockquote>
										
												<ul class="pt-3">
													<li>Create instant meeting</li>
													<li>Start meeting</li>
													<li>Invite participants/share meeting link</li>
													<li>On/off audio and video</li>
													<li>Taking notes</li>
													<li>Chat</li>
													<li>Share screen</li>
													<li>Record meeting</li>
													<li>End meeting</li>
													
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p class="pt-3">The participants were able to navigate through the app easily.  They appreciated the interface and gave the following inputs.</p>
											<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3">Suggestions to make the experience better</h4>
											<blockquote>
										
												<ul class="pt-3">
													<li>Found it is difficult to locate the request control button while the screen is being shared.</li>
													<li>On the join meeting page not sure about the name was editable</li>
													<li>The dark theme gives a dull experience for a few (was in the roadmap)</li>
													<li>There is a chance of clicking the exit button accidentally</li>
													
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<p class="pt-3">We took serious about the feedback and covered and tested it again with the users.</p>
											
											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Conclusion:</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">Apart from revamping the meeting app other possibilities include focusing on enhancing,  meeting toolbar minimal for anything you need during a meeting. On the whole, I have learnt a lot more about user research, to use and create symbols/components, create own icons and illustrations
