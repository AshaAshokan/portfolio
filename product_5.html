										<h3 class="blog_heading">About app</h3>
										<p class="pt-3 pb-3">In this case study, we will explore the process I have followed to improve the mobile site (msite) by transitioning to a bloks framework, aiming to provide a more intuitive and engaging mobile user experience. I'll examine the steps taken, the challenges faced, and the results achieved.
											<br><br>While we've worked on multiple surfaces as part of this comprehensive project, this case study will provide an in-depth analysis of the transformation of the edit profile screen to deliver a better mobile user experience.</p>
										 
										
											
											

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Problem Statement</h3>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3"><b>Challenge:</b> The existing edit profile screen on our msite faced usability issues, impacting users' ability to navigate and update their information. While this case study zooms in on the edit profile screen, it's important to note that it's part of a broader initiative to improve multiple screens within the framework.

											</p>
											<p class="pt-3 pb-3">
												<b>Objective:</b>  This redesign aimed to address usability issues, enhance performance, and provide a seamless editing process. While we have worked on many screens, the focus here is on the edit profile screen as an illustrative example.
											</p>
											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Goals</h3>
											<ul class="pt-3">
												<li>Improved Usability: To create a user-friendly edit profile screen that's intuitive and easy to use.</li>
												<li>Performance Enhancement: Optimize the performance of the screen to ensure it loads quickly and provides a responsive experience.</li>
												<li>Visual Consistency: Ensure that the screen design maintains visual coherence within the framework's block system.</li>
												<li>Streamlined Editing Process: Simplify the process of updating user information.</li>
											</ul>
											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Research</h3>

												<h5 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span> Usability Test</h5>
												<p class="pt-3">
													Conducted usability testing sessions with 15 participants.
													Tasks included updating profile information, changing profile pictures, and adjusting privacy settings.
													Observed user behaviour, noted task completion times, and recorded any difficulties.
													
													</p>
												
													
													<h5 class="blog_heading pt-3"><span style="color: #2568D9;">------</span> Heatmaps and Click Tracking:</h5>
												<p class="pt-3">Utilized analytics tools to generate heatmaps and click-tracking data.
													Identified areas with low engagement and user interaction on the edit profile screen. </p>

													<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3">User Feedback and Pain Points (Qualitative Data):</h4>
													<p class="pt-3">Users reported confusion regarding the arrangement of profile information, with comments such as "Information was scattered, hard to find."
														Many users expressed frustration with the previous screen, noting, "Updating my profile felt cumbersome and time-consuming."
														Users frequently mentioned that the old design lacked visual consistency and alignment with the rest of the mobile site.</p>

														<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3">Usability Test Observations:</h4>
													<p class="pt-3">
														During usability testing, users were observed hesitating and making multiple attempts to edit their profile information.
														Users often commented on the cluttered appearance of the old screen, stating that it was "overwhelming."
														Several users mentioned that the lack of clear labels and intuitive icons made it difficult to understand the purpose of certain elements.</p>

														<h4 class="blog_heading pt-3">Performance Metrics (Quantitative Data):</h4>
													<p class="pt-3">
														
The average page load time for the old edit profile screen was recorded at 4.5 seconds.
Task completion rates for updating profile information were measured at 65% before the redesign.
User satisfaction scores for the old screen averaged at 2.7 on a scale of 1 to 5..</p>
												
										
													

										

									
											
											

											
									

										

										
											

											
											
												
											

											<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Design and Redesign Process</h3>
											<p class="pt-3">With a clear understanding of the problems to address, the design team proceeded to create the new edit profile screen. The design process involved the following elements: <br><br>
												<b>Modular Block-Based Design:</b> We introduced a modular, block-based design approach to the screen. This design choice aimed to enhance visual consistency and allow for flexible organization of profile information. Each block had a distinct purpose, such as personal details, contact information, and privacy settings, ensuring that users could easily identify and edit the information they needed.  <br><br>
												<b>Layout Streamlining:</b> The layout was reorganized to present a cleaner and more intuitive user interface. We prioritized a logical flow, ensuring that users could update their profile step by step without feeling overwhelmed.Responsive Design: Ensuring a responsive design was a top priority. This design choice meant that the edit profile screen would adapt seamlessly to various mobile devices, providing an equally smooth experience on different screen sizes and orientations.<br><br>
												<b>Team Collaboration:</b> Early in the redesign process of our mobile website (msite), the design team recognized the importance of collaborative efforts to achieve a user-friendly and visually appealing outcome. We regularly engaged in feedback sessions with cross-functional team members, including developers, content creators, and project stakeholders.</p>

												</p>
												<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Success Metrics:</h3>
												<p class="pt-3"> The success of the enhanced edit profile screen was measured through the following key metrics:
													<ul class="pt-3">
														<li>
															 User Satisfaction: User surveys and feedback channels indicated a significant increase in user satisfaction, reflecting an improved mobile user experience.</li>
															 <li>Load Time Reduction: Page load times were quantitatively measured, showing a reduction of 2 sec after the redesign.</li>
															 <li> Engagement Increase: User interactions with the edit profile screen increased by 20%, indicating that users were more actively using the feature. </li>

															<li>	Conversion Rate: The conversion rate, in terms of users successfully updating their profiles, saw an increase of 28%.</li>
														
													</ul>
												</p>
												<h3 class="blog_heading pt-5">Conclusion</h3>
												<p class="pt-3">The transformation of the edit profile screen within the transition from the mobile site (msite) to a block-based framework was a success. By addressing usability issues, optimizing performance, enhancing visual consistency, and streamlining the editing process, we created a user-friendly and visually appealing screen. User feedback and data indicated that this transition greatly improved the user experience, ensuring a solid foundation for future UI/UX enhancements. </p>
